# NG-Circos
NG-Circos - interactive circos for biological data

Circos plots are widely used to display multi-dimensional next-generation genomic data, but existing implementations of Circos are not interactive or can incorporate only limited types of data. Here, we developed Next-Generation Circos (NG-Circos), a flexible JavaScript-based circular genome visualization tool for designing highly interactive Circos plots using 21 functional modules with various data types.

The input data of NG-Circos can be either generated by the supporting python scripts, or directly through the well documented JSON data formats.
